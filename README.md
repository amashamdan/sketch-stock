### Sketch Stock

Welcome to Sketch-Stock. A full stack application to view and capture stocks!
The app is built using HighCharts and Yahoo Finance API.

### The Chart

When the page is loaded, the chart is sketched. On the top left corner the user can select a range (period) of time for which to display data as follows:
- 1m: Last month.
- 3m: Last three months.
- 6m: Last six months.
- YTD: The beginning of the current calendar year to present.
- 1y: Last year.
- All: All availabe data.

On the bottom, the user can use a slider to select another period of time if different than any of the above options.

On the top right corner the user can click the burger icon to capture the chart.

### Adding and removing codes

The user can see a list of the sketched stocks below the chart.

To add a new company, simply enter its code (case insensitive) in the input field.

To remove a company from the list, click on its red delete button. Note that you cannot have less than 1 company on the chart.

Enjoy!
